# A little about python's writing conventions.

# Contrary to most programming languages (meaning the one's whom I have wrote code in)
# python uses PEP 8, in other words, one should name his/her variables and methods using '_' (underscore).

# There will be a link in the bottom of this file for the PEP 8 python code style guide.
# In case you want to read more about it.


# - Variables
long_variable_name_in_python = 'Some String'


# - Methods
def some_method_name():
    return "This method did something"


# ? camelCase ?
camelCase = 'ops not here.'

# As a person who come's from languages such as C# and Java, I misunderstood how the for-loop in python worked.

# The misunderstood range function.

# As a novice in python
# I thought that
#
#                   for(int i = 0; i <=10; i++) {
#                       #code here
#                   }
#

# Is the same as
#
#                   for x in range(10):
#                       #code here
#


# Naturally I was wrong. Therefore this led to, slow and ugly to read python code.


# Let me show you what I mean:


# How does one print the elemnts of a list using a for-loop.
